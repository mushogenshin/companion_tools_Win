List of nice, useful, productivity tools and utilities that I regularly use on Windows

# Windows organization
- Use mutilple desktops (`Windows + Tab`), might feel disoriented and clumsy at first, but after a while it should start feeling better!

- [Always On Top](http://img.labnol.org/di/always-on-top.zip) by `labnol`. Default key combo is `Ctrl + Space`.

- Hold `Win` key while placing the mouse **anywhere** on a window to drag it, by installing [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and run the attached [WindowsWindowDrag](./WindowsWindowDrag/WindowsWindowDrag.ahk) `.ahk` file. This mimics a small yet supremely beautiful behavior in Linux.

- Use [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases) to organize windows into panels, aka. "tiling layout". Download the `.msi` and install.

# Notes
- [Epic Pen](https://epic-pen.com/) is great for quickly taking notes directly onto the screen.

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is great for writing a lot of things, and also for web-clipping. I used `Evernote` and `Wunderlist` before, but now I stick to `Notion`.

# Messaging
- Stay away from `Facebook Messenger` as much as you can. From group chat to even teamwork communication, use [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) for your sanity.

# Image-related
- [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/) of course for all photo reference purposes.

- [FastStone Photo Resizer](https://www.faststone.org/FSResizerDetail.htm) for all blazingly fast photo resizing and conversion needs.

- [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) Gif Recorder to capture portion of your screen as GIF. Extremely lightweight and performant.

- [GIF Scrubber Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gif-scrubber/gbdacbnhlfdlllckelpdkgeklfjfgcmp?hl=en), super helpful for animation students :). Also good for exploding a GIF.

# Utils
- [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/) for batch renaming files and folders. Wonderful tool.

- [Hourglass](https://chris.dziemborowicz.com/apps/hourglass/), a gorgeously designed tool to help with timer.

- [SpaceSniffer](http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/), use it to easily look for locations taking up the most space on your hard drives.

- [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/), to deeply clean up unnecessary junk files in your system with ease.
