# My companion tools (Windows)
List of nice, useful, productivity tools and utilities that I regularly use on Windows. This list is intended for many of my art students.

# Windows organization
- Use multiple desktops (`Windows + Tab`), might feel disoriented and clumsy at first, but after a while it should start feeling better!

- [Always On Top](http://img.labnol.org/di/always-on-top.zip) by `labnol`. Default key combo is `Ctrl + Space` to toggle the topmost window.

- Hold `Win` key while placing the mouse **anywhere** on a window to drag it, by installing [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and run the attached [WindowsWindowDrag](./WindowsWindowDrag/WindowsWindowDrag.ahk) `.ahk` file. This mimics a small yet supremely beautiful behavior in Linux.

- Use [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases) to organize windows into panels, aka. "tiling layout". Download the `.msi` and install.

# Note-taking
- [Epic Pen](https://epic-pen.com/) is great for quickly taking notes directly onto the screen.

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is great for writing a lot of things, and also for web-clipping. I used `Evernote` and `Wunderlist` before, but now I stick to `Notion`.

# Messaging
- My pet peeve and a message to the majority of Vietnamese youth: Stay away from `Facebook Messenger` as much as you can. From group chat to even teamwork communication, use [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) for your sanity.

# Image-related
- [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/) of course for all photo reference purposes.

- [FastStone Photo Resizer](https://www.faststone.org/FSResizerDetail.htm) for all blazingly fast photo resizing and conversion needs.

- [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) Gif Recorder to capture portion of your screen as GIF. Extremely lightweight and performant.

- [GIF Scrubber Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gif-scrubber/gbdacbnhlfdlllckelpdkgeklfjfgcmp?hl=en), super helpful for animation students :). Also good for exploding a GIF.

# Version Control
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/), of course. Admittedly not so easy to learn how to use at first for lay persons, though.

# Utils
- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) for compressing and uncompressing stuffs. No need for `WinZip` anymore.

- [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/) for batch renaming files and folders. Wonderful tool.

- [Hourglass](https://chris.dziemborowicz.com/apps/hourglass/), a gorgeously designed tool to help with timer.

- [SpaceSniffer](http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/), use it to easily look for locations taking up the most space on your hard drives.

- [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/), to deeply clean up unnecessary junk files in your system with ease.

- [SharpKeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys/releases) to remap keyboard.

# Password Manager
- [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) FTW. I used `Dashlane` in the past, but I switched to `LastPass` and never went back.

# Frequently Used Hotkeys
- `Ctrl + W` is almost ubiquitous to close something, be it Explorer windows, Chrome tabs, Visual Code tabs, etc.

- Explorer:
  - `Win + E` to launch new Explorer
  - `Win + D` to `Show Desktop`
  - `Alt + Tab` to cycle through the opened apps
  - `Right-click` in the Explorer empty space, then press `WF` to create new folder
  - `Right-click` on a folder or a file, then press `R` to open its `Properties`
  - `Ctrl + N` to duplicate -- retaining location and history
  - `Shift + Right-click` for even more options
